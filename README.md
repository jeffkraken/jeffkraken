- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jeffkraken aka @abandonfreewifi
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Digital Literacy, Cybersecurity, and Educational Technology.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build a better portfolio.
- ðŸ“« LinkedIN would be the easiest place to reach me. Feel free to connect on there and shoot a message.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first hacking projects were:

    1) an Oregon Trail File Share at a school computer lab.
  
    2) Ripping the contents off a game drive and compiling it locally.
